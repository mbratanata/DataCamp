Introduction to SQL 
By: Nick Carchedi

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a language for interacting with data stored in something called a relational database.
A query is a request for data from a database table (or combination of tables).

- Keyword: SELECT, FROM, LIMIT, DISTINCT, WHERE, COUNT, AND, OR, AS
- Clause (a means of filtering the data is not correct): FROM, WHERE, HAVING
- Operator: IN, LIKE
- Wildcard (a placeholder for some other values): 
     % (will match zero, one, or many characters in text)
     _ (will match a single character)
    
HAVING is to filter based on the result of an aggregate function (GROUP BY)
Example of HAVING usage:
    SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS "Number of employees"
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > 25000
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
