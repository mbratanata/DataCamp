Joining Data in SQL
By: Chester Ismay

Introduction to JOINS:
- INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
    
- OUTER JOIN:
    - LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    - RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    - FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

USING is used when both fields have same name. Instead of, ON table1.field = table2.field, you can simply use USING(field)
